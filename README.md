# Ekster
Ekster a nightengale flywheel baster

if you want to make it go ahead its pretty straightforwared and not super hard but it might not function properly. Hardware is a switch and roughly 40 m3x10 screws. (preferably self tappers but not required)

Why is this on github?
Its not dummyproof and might not work properly thats why its on github together with prototypes. The full release will be on printables here:https://www.printables.com/model/557746-ekster-nightingale-flywheel-blaster

Thanks to/credits/remixed files

Gryphon for pusher
